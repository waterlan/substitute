BUILDING

    If you have a working imake flow on your system
    type the following command to compile:

        ./Compile

    If you don't have a working imake flow
    you can try using the included Makefiles:

        make

    On Windows use msys2 mingw64. Take care you
    have regex library libgnurx installed.

        make -f mingw.mak

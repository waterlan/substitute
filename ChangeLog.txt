	* src/Search_match.cc: Restore original file permissions of the original file.
	  For instance execute permission of shell scripts was lost.
	* src/Search_match.cc: Restore original file owner and group.
	  Not restoring the owner/group could be destructive, eg if root converts a file the
	  original owner cannot read it anymore.
	  Not restoring the group could be a security risk. Eg if the group is
	  changed such that more people are able to read the file.
	* VERSION.h: version 1.4.2
